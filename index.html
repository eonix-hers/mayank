        <h1>Happy Birthday, Mayank! 💖🎂</h1>
        <p>From Manu to Mayank: Oh my dear Mayank, where do I even begin? You're not just my best friend—you're the sunshine that lights up my darkest days, the laughter that echoes in my heart, and the cuddly teddy bear I wish I could hug every single moment. On this special birthday, I want you to know how much you mean to me. We've shared countless adventures, from silly inside jokes that only we get to epic dance-offs in the living room. Remember that time we stayed up all night talking about our dreams? You inspire me to be braver, kinder, and more fun-loving. I hope your birthday is filled with all the magic you deserve: a mountain of your favorite chocolates, surprise calls from loved ones, and maybe even a spontaneous road trip if the stars align. You're turning another year wiser, but in my eyes, you'll always be that goofy kid who makes me smile like no one else. Wishing you endless joy, prosperity, and love that wraps around you like a warm blanket. You're my favorite person in the whole wide world, and I can't wait to celebrate many more birthdays with you. Here's to you, my pookie bestie—may this year bring you closer to all your heart's desires. Muah! 😘❤️</p>
        <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/300x200?text=Cute+Birthday+Cake" alt="Cute Birthday Cake">
        <p>💕💕💕 Sending you virtual hugs, kisses, and a lifetime of pookie love! If I could, I'd bake you a cake as big as the moon and decorate it with all our favorite memories. Happy birthday, Mayank—you're irreplaceable! 💕💕💕</p>

    <!-- Slide 2: About Manu -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide2">
        <h1>About Manu 💖</h1>
        <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/200x200?text=Manu+Smiling" alt="Manu Smiling" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px;">
        <p>Hi Mayank, my dearest pookie bestie! I'm Manu, and if I had to describe myself in one word, it'd be 'adventurous'—but with a side of cuddly chaos. Born and raised in a world of colors and dreams, I've always been the type to turn ordinary days into extraordinary stories. My favorite color? Pink, of course—it's the hue of love, cotton candy, and all things sweet, just like our friendship. I love puppies because they're fluffy bundles of joy that remind me of you: loyal, playful, and always ready for a belly rub. Fun facts about me? Well, my absolute favorite food is chocolate cake, especially the kind with extra frosting that we can share (or not share, depending on the day). I can dance like a pro in my living room, but only when no one's watching—think Bollywood moves mixed with awkward flailing. I've traveled to a few places, but my favorite 'trip' is the one inside my imagination, where we can be superheroes saving the world from boredom. I think you're the coolest person ever because you get my weird sense of humor and always know how to make me feel special. Did you know I once tried to bake cookies from scratch and ended up with a kitchen disaster that looked like a modern art piece? That's the kind of fun we have together. I collect little trinkets that remind me of happy moments, and guess what? You have a whole shelf dedicated to you. Can't wait to celebrate with you—let's make this birthday unforgettable! What about you? Slide to the quiz to test how well you know your pookie! 😘</p>

    <!-- Slide 3: Memories -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide3">
        <h1>Our Pookie Memories 💕</h1>
        <div style="margin-bottom: 40px;">
            <h2>That Time We Ate Ice Cream All Day! 🍨</h2>
            <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/300x200?text=Ice+Cream+Memory" alt="Ice Cream Memory">
            <p>Oh, Mayank, do you remember that glorious summer day when we decided to turn 'snack time' into an all-day feast? It started innocently enough with a single scoop of vanilla, but before we knew it, we were hitting up every ice cream parlor in town. We laughed until our sides hurt, sharing stories about our wildest dreams while the sun dipped low. You got chocolate all over your face, and I teased you mercilessly, but secretly, I loved how carefree you looked. That day taught me that the best memories are made in the simplest moments—sticky fingers, full bellies, and a bond that feels unbreakable. It was pure pookie perfection, and I cherish it like a treasure. You're my favorite memory-maker, and I hope we create a thousand more just like it. 😍</p>
        </div>
        <div style="margin-bottom: 40px;">
            <h2>Our First Movie Night! 🍿</h2>
            <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/300x200?text=Movie+Night" alt="Movie Night">
            <p>Picture this: blankets piled high, popcorn flying everywhere, and us cuddled up on the couch like two peas in a pod. We picked a rom-com that had us in stitches, but the real highlight was the popcorn fight that turned into a full-blown pillow war. You 'won' by tickling me until I surrendered, and we ended up watching the credits in comfortable silence, just enjoying each other's company. That night, I realized how lucky I am to have a friend who turns ordinary evenings into magical escapes. We've had so many movie nights since, but that first one holds a special place in my heart. It was the start of our tradition, filled with laughter, cuddles, and zero regrets. Can't wait for the next one—popcorn on me! Pure pookie bliss. 💕</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Bonus Memory: Our Spontaneous Park Picnic! 🌳</h2>
            <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/300x200?text=Park+Picnic" alt="Park Picnic">
            <p>And let's not forget that impromptu picnic in the park when the weather was just right. We packed sandwiches, fruit, and way too many snacks, then spent hours people-watching and sharing secrets under the shade of an old oak tree. You told me about your fears and hopes, and I felt closer to you than ever. Birds chirped, the breeze was gentle, and for a moment, the world felt perfect. It was a reminder that life's best adventures don't need planning—they just need a friend like you. These memories are the threads that weave our friendship, and I'm grateful for every single one. You're my pookie forever! ❤️</p>
